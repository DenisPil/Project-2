Looking for answers to today’s wrenching challenges, William Martin turns to the Tao Te Ching and finds that while Taoism is known for its quiet, enigmatic wisdom, the Tao can also have the cleansing force of a rushing river.Through his interpretation of this ancient Chinese text, Martin elucidates revolutionary messages condemning power-seeking and greed. He emphasizes that humans have a “natural virtue” that can help them heal the planet; shows how Taoism’s simplicity can be subversive and its flexibility a potent force; and reassures that “when injustice is the rule, justice always lies in wait.”Provocative and stirring, Martin’s Tao flows within and through those who ride the waves of anger and frustration and gently guides them to true freedom.“We have learned the secret of transformation: Injustice feeds our determination. Hate increases our love. Wounds bring forth our healing, and fear uncovers our courage and serenity.”— from The Activist’s Tao Te Ching ...more	Spirituality	Five	https://books.toscrape.com/media/cache/da/0c/da0ca35421a5120b2109028e44a53f56.jpg

Her heart stopped pumping for nine minutes before doctors managed to revive her. In those nine minutes, she went to heaven, stood with God, and was forever changed.Ever since Crystal’s incredible experience, her life has been profoundly different. She has become a brand new person in every conceivable way—heart, mind, soul, and spirit. By dying, Crystal learned how to live. Crystal realized that heaven is real and our true home, but we are still meant to have meaningful lives full of passion and purpose right here on earth. She believes we have to chase heaven while we are still alive and allow God to turn our lukewarm love into a firestorm of faith. Chasing Heaven is the story of how God called to Crystal, what He told her, and how she found a way to get closer to Him again here on earth.Crystal assures us that we don’t have to die and go to heaven in order to ignite our faith. We also don’t have to abandon the lives we have in order to experience God and heaven. Chasing Heaven is about following the path to the Lord, and discovering your spiritual destiny.The journey that followed Crystal’s time in heaven has been difficult, complicated, and surprising—full of twists and turns, setbacks and triumphs, drama and comedy, and everything that makes life so messy and beautiful. ...more	Spirituality	Two	https://books.toscrape.com/media/cache/87/cd/87cd2aa5c4e38244ffcb17b84b0f6efd.jpg

They all feel strongly about who or what they think God is, why things happen the way they do, and what will become of us in the If I Gave You God’s Phone Number… - Survey reveals people's relationships with their CreatorWhat do a Cherokee Medicine Woman, a Death Row inmate, an Afghani Sufi Mystic, a Catholic, a Jew, several praying kids, and Mare Cromwell have in common? They all feel strongly about who or what they think God is, why things happen the way they do, and what will become of us in the future. They question, praise and criticize God in the hopes of better understanding themselves and others. In a world challenged by economic issues, climate change, war, and constant threat of terrorism, people are pausing from their daily routines to ask the deeper questions and wonder about the divine and mysterious nature of their Creator.In this book, author and spiritual seeker Mare Cromwell interviews people from all walks of life, asking, “If I gave you God’s phone number, what would you do with it?” This spiritual memoir, framed by twenty-one interviews with people from all walks of life, combines the oral tradition of Studs Terkel with the soulful searchings of Neale Donald Welsh. If I gave you God’s phone number… offers the reader what only the best books offer—windows into the most authentic reaches of the soul. Cromwell’s conscientious selection of interview subjects, and her deft questioning, which presses them to go deeper and deeper, is what lends the book its striking range. This diorama of spiritual postures—some passionate, some highly intellectualized—is impossible to look away from, infects the reader with a fever of curiosity about the human condition, and then proceeds to administer the careful cure: vivid, compelling testimony. Not only do her many subjects nourish the reader by their telling, but Cromwell too provides ongoing doses of self-revelation, a gesture of honesty that unifies and strengthens the whole picture. Reading If I gave you God’s phone number…. will enrich your view of spiritual life—in all its radiant variety—forever.What people are saying about If I gave you God’s phone number…""I strongly recommend this engaging, thought-provoking book. It is distinguished by Ms. Cromwell's empathy for the interesting and diverse people she searched out to interview about their communication with God. Readers will be stimulated to reflect on their own spiritual journey as well as the author's own experiences and those of the people she has interviewed. Because of Ms. Cromwell's personal candor and insights, I continue to ponder the central question she asked her interviewees in this important and unusual book."" –James Crowfoot, Ph.D., Professor and Dean Emeritus, University of Michigan and former President of Antioch College“Mare Cromwell has done a wonderful job of bringing people's personal views on God and spirituality to the public in this book. These stories will deepen our understanding of the diversity of spirituality in the human experience.”–Garrett Sarley, President of the Omega Institute, author of ""The Essentials of Yoga"" and ""Walking Yoga""ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Mare Cromwell is an author, poet, gardener and environmentalist.

These are the questions that flood our hearts and minds when the unimaginable happens. When things go horribly wrong and the world seems to be unraveling, how do you believe in God s goodness? How do you cling to hope? Chad Veach directs readers away from cliched Sunday school answers that fail to offer real comfort or provide faith-building insights. Instead, he draws from God s promises in the Bible and from the story of his own daughter s diagnosis of a devastating and debilitating disease to reveal simple, purposeful steps for dealing with pain. Resting in God s love, remembering his past faithfulness, and realizing the distinction between having faith and clinging to hope are just some of these steps.
